1- Document the DevOps system and the architecture to be used for the automation of the build process and how it integrates with the installation scripts.
2- Test mailinabox and evaluate it if it's worth integrating into the project, use parts of it or go on on a separate path with a normal roundcube/postfix/dovecot/opendkim/clamav
3- Test mailpile and see if it's worth moving to roundcube, verify that roundcube fulfills the pgp encryption requirement.
4- Test installed services by the script and provide a feedback as a normal user.
5- Do a research on full disk encryption and report on the limitations and the best implementation methods to be conducted.
6- Define the Wizard's UI screens in sequence (requires deeper understanding of the config ... propably postpone it until I can form a better understanding)
7- Install gitlab (Handled by David)
8- Implement opendpi or l7filter
9- Document the iptables part of Librekernel into readme
