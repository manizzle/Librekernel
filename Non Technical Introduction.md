***Who we are***

Libre Router is a technology-based company dedicated to the development of innovative solutions directed towards **data privacy** and **sustainable cyber security**. Our **mission** is to enable people to protect themselves from unwanted data transactions and cyber intrusion. Behind the business model, our **purpose** is no less than **all-out internet data protection**. To achieve this goal, our product implements a wide arrayal of software and hardware technologies, perfectly tuned and turned into a plug-and-play device. 

***Why should we care about data privacy and security?***

We care about data privacy and security to some degree, of course. We also know how far reaching the **ethical implications** of this issues are, specially for people working with sensible data, be it an activist or a physician. There are also economical implications: it is  evident to any person running a business how strong data security, strategic knowledge, and value assesment relate to each other. On the other side, in our informational era it is almost a truism to state how indispensable team-work, communication and in general data flow across regional and transnational boundaries has become. To keep a long story short: **you use internet, right? Then you should care**.

***How to work secure, productive, valuable and responsable with sensible data***

Our data are prone to be captured alike by cyber-criminals, data-greedy corporations, and governments that care more about the transparency of citizens than about the transparency of their administration. This is the more so given the fact that most of our communication occurs through the services of those data-greedy corporations, that governments can obligue the former to deliver data to them through law enforcement, and that both possess the financial leverage to hire the most skilled cyber-criminals to pursue their interests. https://ksr-video.imgix.net/projects/1830782/video-546980-h264_high.mp4

Additionally, as soon as we open a door to the internet, every attack to compromise your device is possible, and more probable to happen if we are "on the road" with one of the two most widely spread comercial operating systems. Such a situation ends up exposing even those sensible data we were in the first place never disposed to transfere over the internet. There are situations where a lot of convinience with a little bit of security is not enough, we need plenty of both. To stay productive and valuable, to be responsable with our customers, our informants, or even to safe lifes.

***But, we have a firewall, antivirus-software and a AdBlocker installed!***

Sure, there are a lot of standarized security meassures implemented in every computer today, but many of the threats to our privacy and data security do not depend exclusively on the features of one node in the network -your computer- but are intrinsic to the way most people uses the internet: centralized services of communication and storage, closed source software operating this services, unencripted data transfer, and lack of anonymization. Most of this practices are caused by a blend of technical and economical convenience (configuration of encription is complicated, "free" services are cheaper, etc.)

***Do you? If the internet functions the way we say, where the problem is?***

It is not the way the internet functions, but the way we use it. All the technologies needed to use it productively and simultanously enhance security and privacy are available, even free. Know-how, reliability, technical and economical convenience -all of it integrated in a plug and play device- that is the added value we deliver. 

***Our commitment to sustainability***

Our philosophy is based on the pillars of **sustainable cybersecurity**: **data anonymization, data decentralization, e-mail encryption, ad blocking and filtering, indestructible storage, green energy efficiency and social collaboration**. LibreRouter has been developed to be an Open Source hardware with no malignant backdoors in the used programs, with source code for kernel logic as well as firmware where Open Source developers will have as much control as possible to bypass the censorship and ensure security for the users.

***How we identify the target market of sustainable cybersecurity***

Our target group is based on early adopters (people interested in new gadgets), cityzens and companies in conflict-ridden countries, value-conscious consumers (people who care about sustainable consumption), pro-free-download internet users and anti-advertising users who look for comfort and safety internet navigation.

***Ok, I want to know more about Libre Router!***

Grate. In our technical explanation you can delve into the details. You can find a thorough explanation about centralization, closed source, lack of encription and anonimization, but also about the inconvenience of other solutions like local storage. Further you will find a more explicit description how the technologies implemented in Libre Router work and enable you to deal with this problems. You will also find information regarding the advantages of Libre Router vis a vis similar products on the market. Finally, there you can also find out more about the importance of green solutions and how they relate to decentralization.

***The solution: How does Libre Router protect all-out Internet data?***

Technical attributes of Libre Router:

1. Secure **open operating system** with the hardened version based on Debian Libre and LFS. 
2. Decentralization of the services you consume from the cloud at local alternatives (making it impossible to apply big data enemy corps.)
3. **Decentralization and anonymization of Search Engine** with admin rights.
4. **Filter-connection for the Social Networks** in one single place using decentralized social network Friendica.
5. **Decentralization of video conferences** based in XMPPoverTOR or WebRTC.
6. **Secure storage system** with collaborative tools based in TahoeLafs over i2P and blocksnet.
7. **Transparent e-mail encryption**.
8. **Anonymous web traffic enforcer Ad-blocker, intrusion prevention system, anti-virus and anti-tracking technology for your web browsing, filtering viruses, exploits, malware, ads, bad reputation IPs, and tasteless content**.
9. **Protection** from different services that track data transactions like Internet proxy, clamav, surikata proxy, snort unbound DNS lists, iptables, etc.
10. **Self hosted obfuscated authentication** (dissolves the legal relation between user-human and legal-name), forcing encryption in transport and in rest data.
11. **Network filtering of metadata** that expose you, like scripts, cookies, browser info, docs meta, etc.

***7. Decentralized Social Network***

Librerouter can act as a unified entry and outgoing point for all of your posts across social networks, as well as a filter for what is important to you. For example, do you hate cat videos? (Really? Can I get you some help?)
You can use Librerouter to filter them out when it automatically imports posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest!
You control your incoming and outgoing posts, and push your posts from a single place to everywhere with no need to open each social network in a separate tab. We aren’t asking you to give up on social media, instead we offer you a way to be in the captain’s chair.


***8. Decentralized Indestructible Storage; the RockStar app***

Imagine all the important information you have stored on the hard drive of your computer. You are just one hardware failure away from disaster. After all, when did you do your last backup? Unfortunately, centralized storage solutions such as Dropbox and Google Drive also present a variety of risks:

• Data kidnapping: A real example was Mega. (FBI closed it in 2009). 
• Disaster: Your external hard disks fail or stolen. (no disaster recovery)   
• Privacy: You're at risk of having your data hacked and stolen if it’s not encrypted.

#Technical Overview

![gridstorage](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/16.png)

The decentralized (i2p) version of Tahoe LAFS-Grid (with protections against Sybil attacks and upload Dodos) is a new way to make your data indestructible. A grid splits your files up into little pieces, encrypts them, and spreads them out geographically, making the data immune to any disaster or service outage.
In our decentralized system your valuable information is encrypted three times:
1. Before it even leaves your computer, in the web browser
2. In the collaboration tool before the data goes to the hard disk
3. When backing up to the grid, the slices will also be encrypted.

#***Overview of Linux Libre and Libre Kernel for personal cyber security and privacy***

##Overview of Libre Kernel components:

##***Introduction to what is called a 'Pseudo Backdoor' (a secret entry door in the program's code)***

Software components with no available source code (how the program was made) are called binary blobs (Binary Large Objects) or a collection of binary data stored as a single obscure object. As such, they are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel like hard drives, Ethernet, USB controllers, graphic cards etc. Though generally redistributable, binary blobs do not give the users the freedom to review the source code, or any other programmer the ability to check the program itself, audit, scrutinize, modify or, consequently, redistribute any further evoluted version.
[Blob Example](#blob-example)

#Technical Overview

##***Technical documentation: About Linux Libre***

Linux Libre is a free/Libre version of the Linux kernel suitable for use with the GNU Operating System.
It removes non-free components from Linux that are disguised as source code or distributed in separate files. It also disables run-time requests for non-free components, shipped separately or as part of Linux, and documentation pointing to them. The GNU Linux Libre project takes a minimal-changes approach to cleaning up Linux, making no effort to substitute components that need to be removed with functionally equivalent free/Libre ones.

As explained earlier, it's an operating system kernel and a GNU package whose aim is to remove from the Linux kernel any source code with blobs, with obfuscated source code, or proprietary licenses. Software components with no available source code are called binary blobs and, as such, are mostly used for proprietary firmware images in the Linux kernel.

##Ways of Proprietary firmware removal and its good effects

1. Deblobbing : This is the cleaning up and verification of Linux tarballs and patches for non-Free blobs. This is done using the script files deblob-check for verifying the Vanilla Linux kernel tarball for any non-free proprietary blobs. Similarly, for removing the blobs there is a scripts deblob-* where * represents the Kernel version it's tested and applicable for. The script can be found here <http://www.fsfla.org/svn/fsfla/software/linux-libre/scripts/>

2. VRMS(Virtual Richard M. Stallman)
A program that analyzes the set of currently-installed packages on a Debian-based system, and reports all of the packages from the non-free tree which are currently installed. Software gets categorized in the non-free tree when it is agreed not to be too problematic for 
Debian to distribute but does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines and, therefore, cannot be included in their official distribution. For each program from "non-free" installed, VRMS displays an explanation of why it is non-free, if one is available. More information about VRMS can be found at <https://alioth.debian.org/projects/vrms/>

3. Keep the base deblobbed kernel compilation clean:
Use clean basement and don't allow installation of 3rd party software that is established by trust control as free of blobs. An example of this for Linux Libre can be found at <http://www.linux-libre.fsfla.org/pub/linux-libre/releases/LATEST-4.6.N/> 

###Kernel

The Linux kernel is a Unix-like computer operating system kernel. The Linux operating system is based on it and deployed both on traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions[9], and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs and NAS appliances. The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones and smartwatches is also based atop the Linux kernel.
The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds[10] for his personal computer with no cross-platform intentions, but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures, many more than other operating systems or kernels.

Debian vanilla kernel:
- Doesn't include any non-free firmware (bugs aside), but it allows users to load non-free firmware if they wish to do so, which might pose the same kind of threats as Trojans, tracking, kernel training with malicious software, sniffing, etc.
	
Linux Libre kernel:
- The Linux Libre kernel doesn't include any non-free firmware or anything looking like firmware, and it prevents users from loading non-free firmware even if they wish to do so.
- Is built by running a deblob script on the kernel source code. This goes through the kernel source code and makes various firmware-related changes. 
- Any firmware for which source code is available is preserved, but the script must confirm that the source code is available. 
- Any module requiring firmware is stripped of the ability to load it. 
- Any source code which looks like firmware (sequences of numbers) is removed. 
- Any file containing only firmware (e.g. the contents of firmware/radeon) is removed. 
	
##Libre Router

In the previous section we talked about Linux Libre which is a Linux based operating system kernel and a GNU package.
In this and the following few sections we are going to talk about its counterpart called LibreRouter which is no more than an Open Source hardware with no malignant backdoors in the used programs, with source code for kernel logic as well as firmware where Open Source developers will have as much control as possible to bypass the censorship and ensure security for the users.

After a series of tests requested, I must say that we are not using any type of non-free package, passing vrms does not detect any.

root@librerouter:~# vrms

No non-free or contrib packages installed on librerouter!  rms would be proud.
root@librerouter:~# 

DPKG
checking contrib/non-free

root@librerouter:~# dpkg-query -W -f='${Section}\t${Package}\n' | grep ^non-free
root@librerouter:~# dpkg-query -W -f='${Section}\t${Package}\n' | grep ^contrib
root@librerouter:~# aptitude search '~i ?section(non-free)'
root@librerouter:~# aptitude search '~i ?section(contrib)'

BLOBS

The blob-check script has found one blob in the current kernel of debian jessie, it is related to the free driver of nvidia, maybe it is a false positive but it will be removed when the free kernel (fsfla) is implemented in its entirety.

root@librerouter:/usr/src# /bin/bash deblob-check linux-source-3.16.tar.xz 
linux-source-3.16/drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/engine/xtensa.c within
linux-source-3.16.tar.xz
root@librerouter:/usr/src# 


In the simplest terms it's a GNU Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH) running GNU software.

A unique integration of open source hardware by GNU software maintained by the Open Source community.
With minimal training and simple documentation you can achieve a decrease in cyber risks levels and increase your privacy.
The aim is to make it really very easy to use for all people, even those without technical computer and networking knowledge, while serving as a simple plug and play system to make your traffic untraceable and secure. It is the future of home networking and only privacy viable data center infrastructure. 

##Open Source Hardware

![ddvdvdvd](https://github.com/Librerouter/Librekernel/blob/gh-pages/images/correction_bulk.jpg)

It consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. Both free and 
open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and 
apply a like concept to a variety of components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as free and open-source hardware (FOSH). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical 
drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated circuit layout data), 
in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/Libre terms. The original 
sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. There is now significant 
evidence that such sharing can drive a high return on investment for investors.

### Licenses for being open

####LGPL (Lesser General Public License):
The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). 
The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own 
(even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source 
code of their own components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source 
code availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library such 
as a DLL, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used 
for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications. Please visit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License> 

####CC (Creative Commons) License:
A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of 
an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, 
and build upon a work that they have created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, they might choose 
to allow only non-commercial uses of their own work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's 
work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the 
license by which the author distributes the work.

###***Hardware openess license and confusing "open" terms***

The market is full of crowdfunded projects where the funders claimed that the project is based in open hardware.
What becomes evident following extensive research is that they require the operation of a full range of so-called binary blobs (possible backdoors), chipset restrictions (software required to be signed by the manufacturer), and questions about missing or obfsucated documented parts or schemas/diagrams. The result could be any of these possibilities:

- ARM Trustzone is a blackbox: TrustZone technology within Cortex-A based application processors is commonly used to run trusted boot and is a trusted OS to create a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Typical use cases include the protection of authentication mechanisms, cryptography, key material and DRM. As you can imagine this is a big antiopen market mechanism.

- Device drivers: the controllers or chipset may not be opensource (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)
- No source code or the compiler is not opensource
